## Hello!

:::{.incremental}
- I am Ayush.
- I work at the intersection of data, policy and development.
- I sometimes teach data analysis skills using R to those who will suffer me.
:::

## What is the talk about?

I think the two must read books on data viz are [Data Visualization by Kieran Healy](https://socviz.co/) and [Fundamentals of Data Visualization by Claus Wilke](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/).

:::{.incremental}
- I will walk through some interesting examples from these books.
- We will look at motivations for data visualization
- Markers of good and bad data visualization
- Some common mistakes to avoid
- Where and how to learn more
